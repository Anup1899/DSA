// Radix Sort follows non-comparable approach
// Numbers are sorted by their place (unit --> tenth --> hundredth)
// Sorting of the data has an average time complexity of nlogn using merge and quick sort
// For some cases we want to make the sorting algorith more faster than nlogn
// Which is possible my sorting the data by non-comparable approach
